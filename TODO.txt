TO DO
  Location
    -Use geofire to do a conditional fetch. Get locations within X miles of coordinates Y,Z. Hardcode user location to start.
    -Change the hardcoded user coordinates to actually pull from the user's GPS
    -If possible, list the locations with the closest at the top
  Business Side
    -Create new app with a ListView
    -Hardcode a location into a redux store
    -Instantiate firebase on index.ios
    -Pull in orders from firebase with componentWillMount of ListView component
    -Make OrderMetaItem component to fill in the list 
    -onPress move to a new component that will also be a ListView
    -The order ListView will render the order items

    Current location banner - when clicked it should bring up a modal with details about that location. The user can then click to navigate to the change location scene or say 'ok' and return to the menu

    Menu - should filter menu items to only show items that match with it's own menu. 

    Locations - should have a subtitle that displays the location's address below the title. 

    Save Favorites - move the text input line to be more intuitive ; make sure that it is easy to exit the keyboard. clicking on the screen should dismiss the keyboard. 

    Snacks - list view with item titles and a short description below it, the price will be on the right. OnPress render a details component with a picture, a more detailed description, the price, and an 'add to order' button. 


*********************** Liabilities ************************

** Check the confirm password entry on registration screen (only let the user submit the form if the passwords match)

**Make sure that users canâ€™t add items to cart or favorites -if they have not completed the form. (Not selected a size etc.)

**Disable landscape view. Portrait only

**Currently hard coded price and location data will need to come from the database. Eg: Price of certain coffee sizes and expresso shots etc. If hard coded then we will not be able to update the prices without user updating the app.

**Extra Long coffee descriptions run off the page. Perhaps cut them into two lines. decaf, espresso, and flavor on the first, Cream/Sugar on the next 

**Lemon and Honey buttons needed for tea

**Error handling!! Add catches to network requests and notify user when there are issues

**For now just assuming that the GPS will be enabled. Eventually need to add the option to search loations by zip code, address etc. 

**When you select the lowest item on the checkout listView the buttons render outside of view
